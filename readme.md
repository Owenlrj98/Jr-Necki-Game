Idea Plan
Const:
Snake Starting Position

Variables:
Food Position
Controls
Collision true/false
Snake length
Speed

Concept:
Retro snake game involving the player/user controlling a snake to eat "food" that will allow them to gain points.
Controls:
1. The snake will be constantly running until losing condition.
2. Arrow Keys will allow the user to change the snake's direction.

Goals and losing conditions:
1. To eat as many food as possible to get higher score. Eg. one food = 10points
2. Losing Condition - When the snake hits the border of the game board or collision with self body = Game Over.

Playing area and sizes:
1. Gameboard size = 500 x 500 width x height 
2. Snake initial size = 25 x 25 - Length +25 every food eaten.
3. Score board above the playing area

Possible Modifications in the future:
1. Obstacles? Speed Up? (To be decided after game is done)

Visuals
1. Snake will be made of square blocks 
2. Food will be circular locks

Other details:
1. Food needs to be spawned randomly, and not within the snake's body
2. Make a pause button eg. ESC
3. Restart Button after game over
4. Show high score after each game.
